## Purpose

This is a `Go` package that implements a _partitioned map data structure_ for storing key-value pairs. Key features include:

- Using a partitioning strategy with CRC32 hashing to distribute keys across multiple partitions,
- thread-safe implementation with mutex locks for concurrent access,
- generic implementation supporting any value type,
- designed for efficient concurrent access by reducing lock contention,
- implements standard map operations (`Get`, `Put`, `Delete`, etc.).

The package is designed to provide better performance than a standard map when used in highly concurrent environments by sharding the data across multiple partitions.

## Installation

You can use `Go` to install this package for you:

    go get -u github.com/mwat56/partitionmap

## Usage

    //TODO

## Libraries

The following external libraries were used building `partitionmap`:
