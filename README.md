## Purpose

This is a `Go` package that implements a _partitioned data structure_ for storing key/value pairs. Key features include:

- Using a partitioning strategy with CRC32 hashing to distribute keys across multiple partitions,
- thread-safe implementation with mutex locks for concurrent data access,
- generic implementation supporting any value type,
- designed for efficient concurrent access by reducing lock contention,
- implements standard map operations (`Get`, `Put`, `Delete`, etc.).

The package is designed to provide better performance than a standard map when used in highly concurrent environments by sharding the data across multiple partitions.

## Installation

You can use `Go` to install this package for you:

	go get -u github.com/mwat56/partitionmap

## Usage

### Basic Usage

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/mwat56/partitionmap"
	)

	func main() {
		// Create a new partition map for string values
		pm := partitionmap.New[string]()

		// Store key-value pairs
		pm.Put("user1", "John Doe")
		pm.Put("user2", "Jane Smith")

		// Retrieve values
		value, exists := pm.Get("user1")
		if exists {
			fmt.Printf("Found user1: %s\n", value)
		}

		// Delete a key
		pm.Delete("user2")

		// Check map size
		fmt.Printf("Map contains %d entries\n", pm.Len())

		// Iterate over all entries
		pm.ForEach(func(aKey string, aValue string) {
			fmt.Printf("%s: %s\n", aKey, aValue)
		})

		// Get all keys
		keys := pm.Keys()
		fmt.Printf("Keys: %v\n", keys)

		// Clear all entries
		pm.Clear()
	} // main()

### Key Features

1. Generic Implementation: Works with any value type using Go generics.

		intMap := partitionmap.New[int]()
		structMap := partitionmap.New[MyStruct]()

2. Thread-Safety: All operations are thread-safe, making it suitable for concurrent access.

		// Can be safely used from multiple goroutines
		go func() { pm.Put("key1", "value1") }()
		go func() { pm.Get("key2") }()

3. Method Chaining: Most methods return the map itself for chaining operations.

		pm.Put("key1", "value1").Put("key2", "value2").Delete("key3")

4. Efficient Partitioning: Uses CRC32 hashing to distribute keys across 64 partitions, reducing lock contention.

5. Lazy Partition Creation: Partitions are created lazily when needed, saving memory in a sparse map.

### Performance Considerations

- The map uses partitioning to reduce lock contention in concurrent scenarios.
- Partitions are created lazily when needed.
- For high-concurrency applications, this implementation can offer better performance than a standard map with a global lock.

The package is ideal for scenarios where you need a thread-safe map with good performance under concurrent access patterns.
